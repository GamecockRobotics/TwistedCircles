PID is a control mechanism to get to and stay at a specific sensor value. PID uses three terms: Proportion, Integral, and 
Derivative to move the motors to their respective positions. The three terms utilize "Error" calculated as the difference 
between the target position and the actual position as determined by a sensor. 

The Proportion term is calculated as a constant value, kp (the constant of proportion), times the error. Thus, the further
from the target position the higher the term and thus the motor power. 

The Integral term is calculated by accumulating all of the error and multiplying it by ki (the constant of integration). The 
integration term is useful for short distances while the power from the proportional term is low. The total error accumulates 
very quickly so to prevent this term from growing to large, you can either have a maximum total error or only accumulate the 
smaller values close to the target.

The Derivative term is calculated by multiplying the difference between the current error and the previous error by kd (the 
constant of derivation). This term is negative. Its purpose is to prevent the control loop from overshooting the target 
position. Thus if the control loop is approaching the target very slowly, it will slow the loop down more rapidly, but if it 
is approaching very rapidly then it will slow down the power more quickly. This is useful in preventing the motors from 
overshooting the desired position.

The constants of proportion, integration, and derivation are determined experimentally. The goal is to maximize both kp and 
kd such that the motors reach the position as quickly as possible without overshooting the position and oscillating back and 
forth. The constant of integration is then applied as small as possible to allow the motors to get to the desired position as
quickly as possible.
