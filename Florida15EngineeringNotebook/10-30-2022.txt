Changelog (Austin Coded all of this except the bug fix for the indexer was Nathanael)

Added new motor for indexing flywheel on port 3

Set encoder units for all chassis motors to degrees. Previously had
only been the two front motors because autonomous had not yet been programmed.

Added a drive forward function
The theoretical number of degrees to move 1 inch forward is calculated as follows
1 inch forward *  360 degrees  * 5 tooth gear * 200 rpm cartridge = 19.59 degrees on the motor
                 3.25pi inches   3 tooth gear   600 rpm cartridge
This was then tested and adjusted to 19 experimentally

Added a roll function that rolled the rollers for a specified amount of time.

Removed flywheel speed lock based on request from driver, so flywheel will fire regardless of the speed.
Fixed bug in shoot method where indexer would not stop firing. This bug was discovered because of the removal of the 
flywheel speed lock. 
The method was only activated if the indexer was activated or if the launching button was pressed, but because the speed
of the indexer was set to the target speed at the begining of the method instead of the end, when the launch finished, the 
indexer would not be set to the stopped state and would activate the shoot method causing it to shoot again. When the flywheel
speed lock was activated, this was not an issue because the method would stop when the flywheel was not up to speed. This was 
fixed by setting the motor to the target speed at the end of the method.

Added an autonomous
Auotnomous moves the robot to the roller and changes the roller to our alliances color
