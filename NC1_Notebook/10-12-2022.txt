This was the basic user control set up. 

Added a basic deadzone so the robot does not move when the user does not want it to.
The value skips an unnoticeable amount to go from 0 power to 127 when not in deadzone.

Testing different variations with the catapult so then the driver does not have to manually adjust the catapult arm 
every time they shoot. This makes it so then it is fast and acurrate to shoot and reload.
We attempted at using the encoder values to get the arm in the down position but was not accurate enough to stop it at 
the correct time.
