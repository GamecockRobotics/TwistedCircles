Fixed issue with Inertial Sensor. Inertial Sensor calibrates at the launch of the program, which
was causing the sensor to return inf while it was calibrating. This will need to be handled in the
initialization of the program to prevent the program from running into this issue while trying to 
track the position of the robot.

Tested the odometry algorithm and found that the inertial sensor is not precise enough to implement
such a complex tracking algorithm. Since the measurement between each sensor is extremely small
(10 ms), there is not a need to calculate as precisely the changes as small errors in the sensor
readings will produce larger errors in the calculations. 

To fix this, since theta is small, rather than using a polar coordinate system, the algorithm uses
the current heading and changes the global position based on the local raw changes in x and y.

CHANGE LOG
Made theta a double instead of a float for greater precision.

Added a delay at the beginning of the control to allow time for the IMU to calibrate.

Reversed the direction of the forward rotation sensor.

Used only changes in x and changes in y rather than polar coordinate system.

Fixed a conversion error between radians and degrees.

Changed Indexer from toggling on button press to opening waiting a short time then retracting.

Added larger delay to help with debugging.
