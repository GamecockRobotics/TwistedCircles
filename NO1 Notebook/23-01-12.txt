We tested the robot at different positions on the field with different angles and speeds.
We collected data on the angles and speeds that would score in the high goal at different positions.

We then wrote some code in python that takes the given 3 dimensional points and calculates a plane of best fit
minimizing the vertical distance between each point and the plane. 

There was a single outlier in our data that was causing errors in the plane calculations. This was the data point 
for shooting really close to the goal and rather than making an arc into the goal was shooting at the top of the goal
at full power and was bouncing into the goal. This data point was removed for the calculation of the plane of best fit.

This plane will be used with the two dependent variables, Distance from goal and angle of robot, to calculate the desired 
speed of the flywheel.
