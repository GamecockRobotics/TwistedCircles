Designed an Odometry Tracking algorithm to work with 2 tracking wheels and an inertial sensor.

Tested code but Inertial sensor was returning "inf" the programming equivalent of infinity, which
was messing up the program. Did not get to test the algorithm for tracking because of the issue
with the inertial sensor. 

Also added an indexing code for testing purposes.


Odometry Explanation
1) The algorithm gets the change in angle from the gyro sensor. 

2) The algorithm uses the angle changed in addition to the distance traveled by one of the tracking
wheels to calculate the origin of a polar coordinate system.

This is done by dividing the length of the arc traveled and dividing by the change 

3)
