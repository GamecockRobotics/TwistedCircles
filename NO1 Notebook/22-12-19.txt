Fixed issue with Inertial Sensor. Inertial Sensor calibrates at the launch of the program, which
was causing the sensor to return inf while it was calibrating. This will need to be handled in the
initialization of the program to prevent the program from running into this issue while trying to 
track the position of the robot.
