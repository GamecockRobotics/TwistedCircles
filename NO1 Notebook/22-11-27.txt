Created a Java debugging tool to test my algorithm for calculating the location of the robot.

The tool places a rectangle (representing the robot) on the window. Usinf the arrow keys or 
WASD, the user can move the robot on the field. Using 'Q' and 'E' the user can change the 
angle of the robot.
Pressing the Spacebar toggles control from the robot to the sensors. Using the arrow keys or
WASD changes the location of the sensor relative to the robot. Using the 'Q' and 'E' keys
changes the angle that the sensor points at on the wall.

The robot takes the position that the user moves the robot to, to calculate the true x and y 
coordinates as well as the angle that the robot is facing.

Refer to the diagram [11-27-2022 Distance Equations.png] for the equations used to calculate the
angle and position of the robot.
