CHANGELOG

Changed Left Chassis 2 port from port 11 to port 15
Changed Left Chassis 3 port from port 15 to port 13
Changed Right Chassis 3 port from port 10 to port 20
Added a port for the Roller and Indexer, ports 4 and 18 respectively

Added a variable for the indexer target speed

Reversed the Intake motor

Added an LCD display to help with debugging

Removed the toggle intake function and opted instead to keep the intake code in the main control loop
Removed PID as pros has a built in PID function for driving straight

Added a function to check the flywheel speed to ensure that the flywheel was going fast enough before shooting
Added a shoot function that checks to make sure the flywheel is up to speed. If it is, it activates the indexer 
until the indexer hits the physical stopping mechanism, then it returns back to its previous position.
The algorithm utilizes the motor efficiency operation to detect when the motor is being physically stopped.

Made chassis target speed local variables in the main control loop rather than global variables. They no 
longer need to be global variables as we are using the built in PID function.

Changed the intake system to access the shoot function when the intake is reversed. This is because the intake 
is supposed to help index the disks into the flywheel

Changed flywheel from 100 speed to 127 speed because 100 was not enough. Also displayed the flywheel speed on
the lcd display.
